# Contributing to Muesli

Thanks for helping improve Muesli. This project is a native macOS app built
with SwiftPM, AppKit, SwiftUI, and a small set of shell scripts around local
builds and CI shards.

## Requirements

- macOS 14.2 or newer
- Xcode 16 or newer
- Apple Silicon Mac for the main app workflows

## Local Development Build

Maintainer release builds are signed with a Developer ID certificate that
external contributors do not have. For local development, build the isolated
dev app without signing:

```bash
MUESLI_SKIP_SIGN=1 ./scripts/dev-test.sh
```

That installs `/Applications/MuesliDev.app` with bundle ID `com.muesli.dev`
and stores data under `~/Library/Application Support/MuesliDev/`, so it does
not touch your production Muesli install or data.

By default, `scripts/dev-test.sh` uses local-only entitlements. Maintainer
machines keep CloudKit profiles outside this repository under a sibling
`muesli-ios/secrets/` directory, but those profiles are used only when
`--cloud-entitlements` is passed. External contributors should not need Apple
Developer account access for ordinary local development.

Useful dev commands:

```bash
MUESLI_SKIP_SIGN=1 ./scripts/dev-test.sh                # Build and launch MuesliDev
MUESLI_SKIP_SIGN=1 ./scripts/dev-test.sh --reset        # Re-run onboarding, keep data
MUESLI_SKIP_SIGN=1 ./scripts/dev-test.sh --local-only   # Force local-only entitlements
./scripts/dev-reset-permissions.sh                      # Reset macOS privacy permissions for MuesliDev
```

If you do have your own signing certificate, you can override the identity:

```bash
MUESLI_SIGN_IDENTITY="Developer ID Application: Your Name (TEAMID)" ./scripts/dev-test.sh
```

Cloud-entitled local builds require a provisioning profile whose App ID matches
the selected bundle ID and whose certificate matches the signing identity:

```bash
MUESLI_PROVISIONING_PROFILE="/path/to/profile.provisionprofile" \
MUESLI_SIGN_IDENTITY="Apple Development: Your Name (TEAMID)" \
MUESLI_CODESIGN_TIMESTAMP=none \
  ./scripts/dev-test.sh --cloud-entitlements
```

If `--cloud-entitlements` is passed explicitly and no matching profile is
available, the script fails before building. That is expected; use
`--local-only` for contributor builds that do not exercise iCloud sync.
Maintainers switching an existing dev app from Developer ID/local-only signing
to Apple Development/CloudKit signing may need to regrant macOS privacy
permissions once because macOS tracks permissions against the app's signing
requirement.

## Telemetry in Development

Use `scripts/dev-test.sh` for local app testing. It routes anonymous telemetry
to the dedicated `MuesliDev` TelemetryDeck app and labels every signal with
`muesli.channel=dev`; named lanes A, B, and C use the same dev destination with
their own bundle IDs. This keeps contributor and maintainer test traffic out of
the production and preprod TelemetryDeck apps.

Direct SwiftPM or otherwise unconfigured source builds leave telemetry
disabled. Do not enable production or preprod telemetry for local testing, and
do not hardcode TelemetryDeck app IDs in application code or new scripts. Build
scripts that need telemetry routing must use the centralized public identifiers
in `scripts/muesli_telemetry_channels.sh` and select the appropriate non-production
channel explicitly.

New telemetry events must remain anonymous and must not include audio,
transcripts, meeting or calendar titles, clipboard or screen contents, API
keys, auth tokens, local file paths, raw logs, database content, raw localized
error messages, or other user-provided text. Prefer finite, allowlisted values
that can be reviewed and tested.

## Release Signing

Official preprod and stable release scripts require maintainer-only Developer
ID provisioning profiles:

- `com.muesli.preprod` for `scripts/release-preprod.sh`
- `com.muesli.app` for `scripts/release.sh`

Those profiles are not committed to the repository. Maintainers pass them with
`MUESLI_PROVISIONING_PROFILE`; contributors should not need to run these
release scripts for normal PR validation.

## SwiftPM Build Cache

SwiftPM writes build artifacts to `native/MuesliNative/.build` by default,
which can become large across worktrees. Use a shared scratch path for local
testing:

```bash
MUESLI_SWIFTPM_SCRATCH_PATH="$HOME/Library/Caches/muesli-spm/dev" \
  MUESLI_SKIP_SIGN=1 ./scripts/dev-test.sh
```

Do not run concurrent builds from different worktrees into the same scratch
path. Use separate names such as `dev`, `test`, or `agent-1`.

## Tests

Run the native test package:

```bash
swift test --package-path native/MuesliNative
```

For CI-sized local checks, use the shard script:

```bash
./scripts/run_ci_test_shard.sh core
./scripts/run_ci_test_shard.sh dictation-transcription
./scripts/run_ci_test_shard.sh meetings
```

For direct SwiftPM test runs with a shared cache:

```bash
swift test --package-path native/MuesliNative \
  --scratch-path "$HOME/Library/Caches/muesli-spm/test"
```

## Pull Requests

- Keep changes focused and include tests for behavioral changes.
- Mention the test commands you ran in the PR description.
- Use `MUESLI_SKIP_SIGN=1` for local app verification unless you have a valid
  signing identity.
- Use `--local-only` unless your change specifically needs iCloud/CloudKit
  entitlements.
- Avoid committing generated build artifacts, app bundles, model files, or
  local application data.
